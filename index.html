<p>JS Toolkit offers a large number of integrated methods and utilities to help enrich the javascript object library. Javascript was built originally for browsers and as such lacks a large number of data utility methods with are seen in languages such as Python and Ruby. However times have changed and JavaScript is being used more and more in backend platforms. JS Toolkit aims to bridge that gap and provide everyone a modern developer needs to produce fast, secure and tidy code quick and easily.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Getting started is easy. Most people will be using Node.JS - JST is listed on the NPM registry under 'toolkit'. As it is a generic framework we recommend you use it in all your projects. So install it globally by:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
npm install -g toolkit
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Then to use it within any of your projects simply put the following at the top of your main js file. Note you don't have to continue requiring it on every module as it only needs to be required once!</p>

{% highlight js %}
require('toolkit');
{% endhighlight %}
